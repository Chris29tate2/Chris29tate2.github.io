I decided to learn this course because ive been thinking what I could do that involved a computer and creating something and would also be a good career. I thought what could I do and where is the world going in the future. So I thought its going into electronics, robotics and the internet. Which all these things would require coding to some degree. I think learning this skill to work as a coder would be a good a career and a good qualification under my belt. Im looking forward to learning even though I know its going to be tough but im willing to give it a shot and my all.
